there is 4 mistakes on this program
1st problem is line 7:

int integer1 /* first number to be input by user  */
in this line the semicolon is missing

correct usage is:
int integer1; /* first number to be input by user  */


2nd problem is in line 8:

int integer2 /* second number to be input by user */
in this line semicolon is missing

correct usage is:
int integer2; /* second number to be input by user */

3rd problem is in line 9:

int x;      /* variable in which sum will be stored */

in line 9 x is defined as sum variable but not used after definition 
for example in line 17:
sum = integer1 + integer2; /* assign total to sum */

if we change x in line 9 as:
int sum;      /* variable in which sum will be stored */
the problem will be solved.

4th and final problem is in line 11:

printf( Enter first integer\n ); /* prompt */
double quotes missing in this prompt

correct usage:
printf( "Enter first integer\n" ); /* prompt */
